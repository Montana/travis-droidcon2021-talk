# Running Android emulators in Travis CI (Best Practies): A demo for Droidcon 2022 in San Francisco, California

With this process I was able to spin up an emulator on Travis and run integration tests, on both `Linux` and `macOS`. Remember `Android Tools` does not care what emulator it runs, (Itâ€™s up to the developer to set-up the emulator they want).

Things we are using:

* Jammy 
* Gradle
* OracleJDK
* Bash
* Arm ABI's 
* Build tools (22-30) 
* VM (2x Large) 

Presentation time extrapolation: 20 minutes. If you have any questions for me about my dmeo, please email me at [montana@linux.com](mailto:montana@linux.com).
